# Shopinvader container ready for deployment

This is the official container for shopinvader

## How to use this image

1. copy the file `docker-compose.yml` of this directory in your project folder
2. copy `.loco-data` folder to your project folder and add ignore its content in .gitignore
3. Run it with ```docker-compose up```.
4. Locomotive is now available on http://localhost:3000


# Develop / Debug

## Static files served from AWS S3

If you are using amazon S3 for storing your asset you need to download them in dev mode.

Before please install aws cli and read the documentation.

In short for installing aws and configuring the api key
```
sudo apt install awscli
aws configure
```

Now let's synchronise the assets

```
aws s3 sync s3://mybucket/sites .loco-data/public/sites
aws s3 sync s3://mybucket/uploaded_assets .loco-data/public/uploaded_assets

```

## Locomotive theme development

The `docker-compose.yml` here provides a `wagon` container as well.
`wagon` is the LocomotiveCMS service to deploy resources to a Locomotive site
or to develop your own theme.

To run it:

```
$ docker-compose run --service-ports wagon gosu ubuntu bash
```
From there you'll be able to run all wagon commands without having to install wagon by yourself.
See https://doc.locomotivecms.com/docs (just skip wagon installation steps).

NOTE: to make wagon work, the docker-compose file should stay inside your Locomotive theme folder.
Otherwise you'll have to change the workspace volume.

# Available Environement Variables

## Locomotive configuration

### ALLOWED_HOSTS

If you want to reach the server with a domain that is not in the list of existing website on your locomotive
you can allow specific domain like this:

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS=foo1.exemple.org,10.10.10.82:3000,localhost:3000
```

### LOCOMOTIVE_ENABLE_REGISTRATION

```
LOCOMOTIVE_ENABLE_REGISTRATION=[true|false] (default: false)
```
Enables self registration on Locomotive admin backend.

### LOCOMOTIVE_ADMIN_SSL_REDIRECT

```
LOCOMOTIVE_ADMIN_SSL_REDIRECT=[true|false] (default: true)
```
Force redirection of admin backend to HTTPS.


## RAILS configuration

### RAILS_ENV
```
RAILS_ENV=[production|development]
```
Tells RoR which kind of env your are working with.

### SECRET_BASE
```
SECRET_KEY_BASE=6810991e8c119bdfe5f4dd[...]d88d1a5bcb69d6ed0cdc19892
```
This key is used to encrypt important data such as cookies and user passwords.
You can generate one by running this command:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm locomotive rake secret
```

As it's used to encode passwords, if you restore a DB locally you must config this otherwise you won't be able login.
The other option is to reset the passwords for admin users.
NOTE: website users are not the same as backend users.

### DEVISE_PEPPER

```
DEVISE_PEPPER=myExtraSecret
```
This is "a string which is appended onto the password pre-hashing but not stored in the database (unlike salt, which is appended as well but stored with the password in the DB); and cost, a measure of how secure the hash should be (see the docs). Both of these are static and you can hard-code them into your non-Devise app (but make sure to keep pepper secret!)."
